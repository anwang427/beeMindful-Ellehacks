# ElleHacks2020 - Bee Mindful

A year of cell phone use emits more carbon dioxide than two round trip flights. More than 19,000 tons of CO2 is emitted by cell-phone users worldwide on a daily basis; this accounts for 7,000 Gigatons per year! By encouraging an internet-addicted generation to re-engage with the world around them through limiting network access in a gamified manner, Bee Mindful works for net-zero emissions and improved mental health amongst youth.

Bee Mindful operates on a multi-dimensional financial model. A virtual garden can be grown in our mobile app through a ‘streaks’ system; by participating in off-phone time on a regular basis, users eventually are able to build their own. By breaking ‘streaks’ every time users utilize the ‘emergency unlock’ function or fail to set beside offline time, they are incentivised to focus more on themselves — thus reducing electricity usage — and also to make impact investments in sustainability projects in return for in-game perks. On top of this crowdfunding financial model, we also implement a subscriber system for more socially-conscious citizens: users are charged on a monthly basis in projects they know will make an impact on the environment. Our application harnesses a game-like interface to encourage even the most addicted teens to spend time outdoors or on other personal goals, while simultaneously incentivising investments in impactful projects that will reduce global carbon emission levels.
